# Membership
The relati√≥n between the Medic with an Hospital are defined by Membership. It could be either "Admin" or "Member".

A MEMBER of an [Hospital](hospital.md) can only prescribe from that Hospital but he is unable to edit it.

An ADMIN of an [Hospital](hospital.md) can Edit its content, view, add and remove the Medics linked to the Hospital.
