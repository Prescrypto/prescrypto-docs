# Membership
The relati√≥n between the Medic with an Hospital are defined by Membership. It could be either "Admin" or "Member".

A MEMBER of an [Hospital](hospital.md) can only prescribe from that Hospital but he is unable to edit it.

An ADMIN of an [Hospital](hospital.md) can Edit its content, view, add and remove the Medics linked to the Hospital.

You can create a relatioship between a Medic and a Hospital trough a Membership

### Fields of a Membership
|Field|Description|
|--|--|
|medic|`Int` ID of the Medic for whom the Membership will be created|
|hospital|`Int` ID of the Hospital to which the Medic will be added, you need to be have an ADMIN Membership to this Hospital|
|type_membership|`String` Can be [ADMIN](membership.md) or [MEMBER](membership.md)|
|is_active|`Boolean` indicates if it's the current active hospital for the Medic|
|is_deleted|`Boolean` determines if the Medic can see or select the hospital from the UI|

```python title="POST /api/v2/management/memberships/"
import requests
import json

url = "{{Base_URL}}}/api/v2/management/memberships/"

payload = json.dumps({
  "medic": 33,  
  "hospital": 1,
  "type_membership": "ADMIN"
})
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Token {{token}}',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)

## Delete Membership
It will generate a "soft_delete" for the membership, the medic will not see anymore the Hospital from the UI. This can be undone by updating the field "is_deleted" to "false" with a PATCH Request.

```python title="DELETE /api/v2/management/memberships/{{Memberhip_ID}}"
import requests

url = "{{Base_URL}}}/api/v2/management/memberships/301"

payload = {}
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Token {{token}}'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)

```


## Update Membership
This will allow you to update your "type of Membership" from ADMIN to MEMBER and undo the soft_deletion of the Membership.

```python title="PATCH /api/v2/management/memberships/{{Memberhip_ID}}"
import requests
import json

url = "{{Base_URL}}}/api/v2/management/memberships/{{Memberhip_ID}}"

payload = json.dumps({
  "is_deleted": false,
  "type_membership": "MEMBER"
})
headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Token {{token}}',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, headers=headers, data=payload)

print(response.text)
